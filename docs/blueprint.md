# **App Name**: FocusCraft

## Core Features:

- Coin Balance Display: Display the current coin balance prominently on the home screen.
- Focus Session Management: Enable users to start focus sessions with customizable durations, earning coins upon completion and facing penalties for early abandonment based on configured thresholds.
- Reward Redemption System: Enable users to exchange coins for rewards they define themselves. Enable editing those rewards, defining names, descriptions, costs, etc.
- Transaction History: Maintain a detailed record of all coin-related events, categorized by session completion, penalties, and redemptions.
- Settings and Customization: Offer configurable settings for session durations, completion thresholds, rewards, penalties, cooldown periods, and the anti-cheat strict mode, all protected by a PIN.
- Anti-Cheat Mechanism: Implement a strict anti-cheat mechanism that pauses or penalizes the timer when the app loses focus or detects time manipulation, preventing users from gaining unfair advantages.
- AI-Powered Motivational Messages: Provide dynamically changing motivational messages to the user during focus sessions. The messages should be provided using a generative LLM, and the app should use a tool that allows it to reason about the state of the focus timer in order to decide whether it should encourage the user or prompt them to take a break
